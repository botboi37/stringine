# stringine
A simple cross-platform string manipulation utility

====================================

We’re aiming to build a string library available for as many languages as possible, with as similar functionality as possible for all platforms.

Stringine is currently under early development and there’s still a lot to be done!
If you want to help, you are welcome to contribute.
